# README

## Part 1

Implemented in `l31.m` and can be run in **MATLAB**. Takes input $H$ and $\eta$.

## Part 2

Implemented in `main.py` and can be run using `python3` (also requires packages `cv2`, `tqdm`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `mtplotlib`). Change location of training images.

## Part 2 - Competition 

Implemented in `main_competition.py` and can be similarly run as **Part 2**, also requires changing location of testing images.

The final results are noted in `comptetion_results.txt` and (not so optimum results due to lack of time to run more epochs until overfitting) using convolutional neural networks are in `competition_results_2.txt`
